My name is Sky! 

I use C# to make games. Python for a tad of machine learning. And JavaScript for web stuff. 

I have a solo indie studio called [Fishagon LLC](https://www.fishagon.com). I make both digital and table top games under that name.

I also run [r/INAT](https://www.reddit.com/r/INAT), which I believe is the web's largest gamedev collaborative search board?
